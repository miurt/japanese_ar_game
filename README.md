## Bachelor's Thesis Project: an android game for learning Japanese with AR and speech input/output

### Limitations: 
• Currently only works on Android devices supporting ARCore

• Samsung devices also can have problems with speech input/output

• iOS support is not implemented for now

• Your phone should have access to the internet

• The game will ask you for permissions to use the camera and microphone

### Instructions for the game:
• In AR scenes you usually need to find a plane. Try zooming in/out, changing the camera's angle

• When the first level without Camera starts, adjust the settings (button on the bottom left)

• You can move and look around by using two fingers (one for movement, one to control the camera)

• You can see what you need to do by pushing (!) (button on the bottom right)

• To interact with objects/NPCs use the interaction button (🔍)

• When a microphone button appears, you need to use speech input

• Answers and NPC‘s speech in dialogues can be played out by tapping on them

• The last AR Scene (after train station) requires markers, which can be printed out or used on a PC’s/tablet’s screen
